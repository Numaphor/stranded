## Requirements

### Development Environment
- **devkitARM** - ARM cross-compilation toolchain from devkitPro
- **Wonderful Toolchain** - Alternative ARM toolchain (optional)
- **Python 3.x** - Required for build tools and asset processing
- **Make** - Build system (GNU Make recommended)
- **Git** - Version control with submodule support

### Runtime
- **Game Boy Advance** hardware or compatible emulator
- **mGBA**, Visual Boy Advance, or similar emulator for testing

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository** with submodules:
   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/Numaphor/stranded.git
   cd stranded
   ```

2. **Initialize submodules** (if not cloned with `--recursive`):
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

3. **Install development tools**:
   - Install [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started) with devkitARM
   - Ensure `DEVKITARM` environment variable is set
   - Ensure Python 3.x is available in your PATH
   - Install Make (available on most Unix systems, or via MSYS2 on Windows)

## Building

### Quick Build
```bash
make -j8
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Kill any running emulator (Windows example)
taskkill /im mGBA.exe /F   # Windows
# pkill mGBA                # Linux/macOS

# Build and run
make -j8
```

### Troubleshooting
If you encounter build errors:

1. **"DEVKITARM not found"**: Install devkitPro and ensure environment variables are set
2. **Python errors**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed and in PATH
3. **Submodule issues**: Run `git submodule update --init --recursive`
4. **Permission errors**: Ensure write access to build directory

### Build Artifacts
- `stranded.gba` - Final ROM file for emulator or hardware
- `stranded.elf` - Debug symbols for development

### Build Configuration
The build system automatically processes assets and uses the following directories:
- `src/` - C++ source files
- `include/` - Header files  
- `graphics/` - Visual assets organized by type:
  - `sprite/player/` - Player character sprites (hero.bmp, agent.bmp, etc.)
  - `sprite/enemy/` - Enemy sprites (mutant.bmp, spearguard.bmp, etc.)
  - `sprite/npc/` - NPC sprites for interactions
  - `sprite/vfx/` - Visual effects
  - `bg/` - Background tiles and maps
- `audio/` - Sound effects (`.wav`) and music (`.it` modules)
- `build/` - Generated build artifacts
