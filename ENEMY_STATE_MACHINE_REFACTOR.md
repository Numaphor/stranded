# Enemy State Machine Refactor - Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The Enemy State Machine has been completely refactored to follow SMART/SOLID principles, replacing the monolithic update method with a clean, extensible architecture.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **EnemyState (Abstract Base Class)**
   - Located in: `include/fe_enemy_state.h`
   - Defines the interface all states must implement
   - Methods: `enter()`, `update()`, `exit()`, `get_state_id()`

2. **EnemyStateMachine (Context Class)**
   - Located in: `include/fe_enemy_state_machine.h`, `src/fe_enemy_state_machine.cpp`
   - Manages state transitions and updates
   - Follows Dependency Inversion Principle

3. **Concrete State Classes**
   - Located in: `include/fe_enemy_states.h`, `src/fe_enemy_states.cpp`
   - Six specialized states: Idle, Patrol, Chase, Attack, ReturnToPost, Stunned

### SMART/SOLID Principles Applied

#### Single Responsibility Principle ✅
Each state class has a single, well-defined responsibility:
- `IdleState`: Handles waiting/stationary behavior
- `PatrolState`: Handles wandering movement patterns
- `ChaseState`: Handles player pursuit behavior
- `AttackState`: Handles combat actions
- `ReturnToPostState`: Handles guard return-to-post behavior
- `StunnedState`: Handles temporary incapacitation

#### Open/Closed Principle ✅
- Easy to add new states without modifying existing code
- New enemy types can be supported by adding new state classes
- Existing states remain unchanged when new behaviors are added

#### Liskov Substitution Principle ✅
- All concrete states can be used wherever `EnemyState` is expected
- State machine works identically regardless of which concrete state is active
- No special handling needed for different state types

#### Interface Segregation Principle ✅
- Clean separation between state logic, movement, and animation
- States only access the Enemy methods they need
- No dependency on unrelated functionality

#### Dependency Inversion Principle ✅
- High-level `EnemyStateMachine` depends on abstract `EnemyState` interface
- Concrete state implementations can be swapped without affecting the state machine
- Easy to mock states for testing

## Migration Strategy

### Backward Compatibility
The refactor maintains full backward compatibility:
- Original `update()` method unchanged by default
- New `update_with_new_state_machine()` method for new architecture
- Migration flag `_use_new_state_machine` allows gradual transition

### Usage

```cpp
// Enable new state machine for specific enemy
enemy.set_use_new_state_machine(true);

// Or use new method directly
enemy.update_with_new_state_machine(player_pos, level, player_listening);
```

### Testing the New System

1. **Individual Enemies**: Set `_use_new_state_machine = true` for specific enemies
2. **Enemy Types**: Enable for specific enemy types (e.g., all SPEARGUARD)
3. **Full Migration**: Eventually enable for all enemies

## State Descriptions

### IdleState
- **Responsibility**: Enemy waits/stands still
- **Transitions**: To ChaseState when player approaches, to PatrolState after timeout (non-guards)
- **Behavior**: Zero velocity, watches for player

### PatrolState  
- **Responsibility**: Enemy wanders in random directions
- **Transitions**: To ChaseState when player approaches, to IdleState after patrol duration
- **Behavior**: Random movement direction, collision avoidance

### ChaseState
- **Responsibility**: Enemy actively pursues player
- **Transitions**: To AttackState when close enough (guards), to IdleState/ReturnToPost when player escapes
- **Behavior**: Direct movement toward player position

### AttackState
- **Responsibility**: Enemy performs attack animation/behavior
- **Transitions**: Back to ChaseState or IdleState/ReturnToPost based on player proximity
- **Behavior**: Stationary during attack, handles attack timing

### ReturnToPostState
- **Responsibility**: Guard enemies return to original position
- **Transitions**: To IdleState when at post, to ChaseState if player re-enters range
- **Behavior**: Movement toward original position with slower speed

### StunnedState
- **Responsibility**: Handle knockback and temporary incapacitation
- **Transitions**: To appropriate state based on player proximity after stun duration
- **Behavior**: Temporary immobilization, recovery logic

## Benefits of New Architecture

1. **Maintainability**: Each state is isolated and easy to understand
2. **Extensibility**: New behaviors can be added without touching existing code
3. **Testability**: States can be individually tested and mocked
4. **Readability**: Clear separation of concerns makes code easier to follow
5. **Debugging**: State transitions are explicit and traceable
6. **Performance**: No change in performance characteristics

## Future Enhancements

The new architecture makes these enhancements trivial to add:

1. **New Enemy Types**: Just implement new state classes
2. **Complex Behaviors**: Chain states together for sophisticated AI
3. **Configuration**: States can be parameterized for different difficulty levels
4. **Analytics**: Easy to track state transition patterns
5. **Visual Debugging**: State names can be displayed for debugging

## Implementation Details

### Memory Management
- Uses `bn::unique_ptr` for automatic memory management
- No memory leaks or dangling pointers
- RAII principles followed throughout

### Performance
- Minimal overhead compared to original implementation
- State transitions are O(1) operations
- No heap allocations during normal operation

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of null states
- Safe state transitions with proper cleanup
- Defensive programming practices

This refactor transforms the Enemy AI system from a monolithic, hard-to-maintain implementation into a clean, extensible architecture that follows industry best practices while preserving all existing functionality.
