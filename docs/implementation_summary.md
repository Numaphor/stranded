# Camera System Implementation Summary

## Files Modified

### `include/fe_constants.h`
- **Replaced** old camera constants with Yoshi's Island-style parameters
- **Added** deadzone dimensions (24x12 pixels)
- **Added** lookahead parameters (48px base, scales with velocity)
- **Added** smooth interpolation factors (12%/10% per frame)
- **Added** special event parameters (20% lerp, 100px snap threshold)

### `include/fe_scene_world.h`
- **Added** new camera member variables:
  - `_camera_pos`: Current camera position
  - `_player_velocity`: For lookahead calculation
  - `_special_camera_event_active`: Special event flag
  - `_special_event_position`: Target for special events
- **Added** new camera methods:
  - `_update_camera()`: Main camera update logic
  - `trigger_special_camera_event()`: For trampolines/platforms
  - `disable_special_camera_event()`: Manual disable
  - Utility functions: `_clamp()`, `_sign()`, `_lerp()`

### `src/fe_scene_world.cpp`
- **Replaced** old simple camera logic with sophisticated Yoshi's Island algorithm
- **Implemented** deadzone system with separate X/Y handling
- **Implemented** velocity-based lookahead calculation
- **Implemented** smooth camera interpolation
- **Added** special event handling with auto-disable
- **Added** level boundary clamping
- **Updated** constructor to initialize new camera variables

### `include/fe_player.h`
- **Added** velocity accessor methods `dx()` and `dy()`
- Allows camera system to read player movement data

### `include/fe_level.h` & `src/fe_level.cpp`
- **Added** `get_level_width()` and `get_level_height()` methods
- Enables camera boundary clamping to prevent showing empty space

## New Features

### 1. Deadzone System
- 24x12 pixel deadzone around camera center
- Player can move within deadzone without triggering camera movement
- Prevents jittery micro-adjustments

### 2. Velocity-Based Lookahead
- Camera looks ahead based on player's current velocity
- Up to 48 pixels horizontal, 24 pixels vertical
- Scales smoothly from 0-100% based on player speed
- Creates the "player left-of-center when moving right" effect

### 3. Smooth Interpolation
- Configurable smoothing factors (12% horizontal, 10% vertical per frame)
- Natural camera movement without lag
- Separate timing for X and Y axes

### 4. Special Camera Events
- Fast camera movement (20% lerp per frame) for special events
- Instant camera snaps for distances over 100 pixels
- Auto-disables when camera reaches target
- Perfect for trampolines, platforms, boss intros

### 5. Level Boundary Clamping
- Camera constrained to actual level bounds
- Uses GBA screen dimensions (240x160) for calculations
- Prevents showing empty space outside designed areas

## Algorithm Overview

Each frame, the camera system:

1. **Calculates lookahead** based on player velocity and direction
2. **Tests deadzone boundaries** separately for X and Y axes  
3. **Applies smooth interpolation** toward desired position
4. **Handles special events** with fast movement or instant snaps
5. **Clamps to level bounds** to stay within designed areas

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal**: Only adds a few math operations per frame
- **Optimized**: Early returns for null checks
- **Efficient**: Uses Butano's fixed-point math throughout

## Compatibility

- **Fully backward compatible**: Existing code continues to work
- **Non-breaking**: All existing camera usage remains functional
- **Optional**: Special events are opt-in via explicit API calls
